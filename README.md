# General-Student-System
A gradebook and attendance-tracking system for teachers, with specific course/class data and a student-side interface for students to see their attendance and grades by class (read-only).
Both include a login system that pulls school data from a database. Built using Java Swing and mySQL, special thanks to the FlatLaf team for the GUI look and feel.
